With `arena'' as main entity of sub-question 1, we extract `home'' to be replaced with `playoff''. Then, we use the modified sequence with the original sub-question 2 (masking the answer `Androscoggin Bank Colise´e''.) as prompt to GPT-4 to generate the distractor paragraphs 1 and 2. The distractor paragraphs generated have ``Maple Leaf Arena'' as the bridging entity in the false reasoning chain which leads to the wrong answer [ILLEGIBLE].}}{6}{figure.3}\protected@file@percent }
