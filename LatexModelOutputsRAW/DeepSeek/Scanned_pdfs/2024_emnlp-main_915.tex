\begin{abstract}
Human cognition exhibits systematic compositionality, the algebraic ability to generate infinite novel combinations from finite learned components, which is the key to understanding and reasoning about complex logic. In this work, we investigate the compositionality of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we construct a new dataset $\mathrm{MATHTRAP}^{\ddagger}$ by introducing carefully designed logical traps into the problem descriptions of MATH and GSM8K. Since problems with logical flaws are quite rare in the real world, these represent "unseen" cases to LLMs. Solving these requires the models to systematically compose (1) the mathematical knowledge involved in the original problems with (2) knowledge related to the introduced traps. Our experiments show that while LLMs possess both components of requisite knowledge, they do not spontaneously combine them to handle these novel cases. We explore several methods to mitigate this deficiency, such as natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and fine-tuning. Additionally, we test the recently released OpenAI o1 model and find that human-like 'slow thinking' helps improve the compositionality of LLMs. Overall, systematic compositionality remains an open challenge for large language models.

\section{Introduction}
Humans excel at learning fundamental concepts and skills, systematically combining them to solve new problems. For instance, when a person possesses (a) the knowledge of how to solve quadratic equations with one variable, and (b) the understanding of what integers are, they can combine these two domains of knowledge to tackle the problem "Find the integer solutions of $x^{2} + x =$ 3. "They would first solve the equation, and then determine whether the obtained solutions are integers or not. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) had a famous viewpoint that artificial neural networks lack this compositionality, and thus cannot serve as reliable cognitive models. Current LLMs have achieved unprecedented success on tasks requiring complex reasoning (Guo et al., 2024; Toshniwal et al., 2024). We wonder whether compositionality still poses a significant challenge for LLMs?

Toward this goal, we construct a new MATHTRAP dataset by introducing carefully designed logical traps into the original problems of the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) datasets. For example, by modifying the original problem "Find the solution of the equation $x^{2} + x = 3$ " to "Find the integer solution of the equation $x^{2} + x = 3$ " the model needs to combine (a) the knowledge involved in the original problem (how to solve quadratic equations with one variable) and (b) the knowledge about the trap (the definition of integers) to handle these trap problems (in fact, the original equation has no integer solutions). Another reason for evaluating compositionality through trap problems is that these problems rarely appear in the real world, so it is unlikely that LLMs provide the correct answers solely by following the trained reasoning paths.

We conduct comprehensive tests on leading LLMs and recruit 43 undergraduate students from top universities as human controls. We find that LLMs and humans exhibit strikingly different behavioral patterns when dealing with trap problems. Despite possessing both (a) and (b) knowledge components, LLMs fail to spontaneously compose them to handle trap problems, while humans can. This suggests that tasks requiring compositional generalization remain challenging for current LLMs. Furthermore, the ability of well-aligned LLMs to handle trap problems can be elicited through external interventions, such as natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and supervised fine-tuning. Furthermore, we find that the human-like 'slow thinking' demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024) also helps improve the compositionality of LLMs. Nevertheless, systematic compositionality remains an open challenge for current LLMs.

The contributions of this work are threefold: (1) We investigate the compositional generalization of LLMs on mathematical reasoning, and demonstrate their stark underperformance compared to humans. (2) An effective method to construct 'unseen problems' by introducing traps into original problems, and a dataset called MATHTRAP that cannot be solved by simply following the reasoning paths seen during training. (3) Comprehensive experiments exploring the impact of model size, the degree of alignment, and external interventions on performance on the MATHTRAP.

\section{Background and Definition}
In this section, we provide the definition of compositionality discussed in this paper, based on Hilbert's formal deductive systems (Hilbert, 1922): Definition 1. (Hilbert's Formal Deductive System) This system consists of (1) a syntax $\mathcal{G}$, specifying which derivation statements are legal, (2) a set of inference rules $\mathcal{R}^+$, clearly stating how new facts (or theorems) can be derived from existing facts (axioms or already proved theorems), and (3) axioms: a predetermined set $\mathcal{A}$ of established facts.

Under this deductive system, reasoning is defined as the process of deriving new facts from existing facts and rules.

Definition 2. (Compositionality in Mathematical Reasoning) Suppose problem sets $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}$ are described using the same syntax $\mathcal{G}$, and $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ can derive final answers through tuple $(\mathcal{R}_{1}, \mathcal{A}_{1})$, $(\mathcal{R}_{2}, \mathcal{A}_{2})$ respectively, while $Q_{3}$ requires reasoning using $\mathcal{R}_{1} \cup \mathcal{R}_{2}$ based on $\mathcal{A}_{1} \cup \mathcal{A}_{2}$ (or a [ILLEGIBLE]).

\section{The MATHTRAP Dataset}
Existing datasets for evaluating compositionality are limited to symbolic reasoning with semantic decoupling (Lake and Baroni, 2023; Dziri et al., 2023). However, the semantics of language play a crucial role in the reasoning process of LLMs (Tang et al., 2024). Our MATHTRAP dataset aims to evaluate the compositionality of LLMs on semantically rich math word problems. More importantly, the 'unseen' feature of our dataset prevents models from simply following the trained reasoning paths to arrive at solutions.

\subsection{Dataset Composition}
Sample Composition: As illustrated in Table 1, each sample in MATHTRAP can be viewed as a problem triplet:

(1) Original problem: Sampled from the MATH and GSM8K datasets. These problems are used to evaluate the model's grasp of math knowledge from these datasets.

(2) Concept Problem: Manually crafted to assess the model's understanding of the trap concepts to be introduced. These problems are intentionally simple, requiring only knowledge of the trap concept to solve.

(3) Trap Problem: Created by manually introducing logical traps into the original problems. These are designed to evaluate the model's compositional generalization ability. Solving these problems requires the model to systematically combine knowledge from the original math problem with the introduced trap concept.

The MATHTRAP dataset consists of two subsets: Public and Private. The Public subset contains 105 problem triplets. Using GPT-4, we paraphrase these samples to expand the dataset to 1,000 problem triplets, which are used in all fine-tuning experiments discussed in this paper. We manually verify the quality of the subset. Please refer to Table 7 for the templates used in paraphrasing. We have made this subset publicly available to facilitate community evaluation of compositionality.

The Private subset comprises 155 problem triplets, and the evaluation results presented in this paper are based on this subset. This portion of the data will not be made public to mitigate the risk of data leakage. See Appendix B for more annotation details about MATHTRAP.

Problem Topic Composition: MATHTRAP comprises problems from two main sources: $15.5\%$ from the GSM8K dataset and $84.5\%$ from the MATH dataset. It covers a diverse range of mathematical topics, including algebra $(23.2\%)$, counting and probability $(22.6\%)$, geometry $(16.1\%)$, prealgebra $(12.3\%)$, number theory $(7.74\%)$, and precalculus $(2.58\%)$.

Trap Categories: We carefully designed five categories of traps for constructing the MATHTRAP dataset. These include: 1) Concept Undefined: The reasoning process involves undefined mathematical concepts (such as $\tan 90^{\circ}$, 0 as a divisor, etc.). 2) Missing Condition: Lacking the necessary conditions required to solve the problem. 3) Direct Contradiction: Two conditions in the problem description directly contradict each other, which can be discovered without complex calculations. 4) Indirect Contradiction: There are indirect contradictions in the problem description, which can only be discovered during the reasoning process. 5) Violating Common Sense: The condition or final answer violates common sense.

\caption{Overview of the MATHTRAP Dataset. The first column represents the five introduced trap types and their percentages in the dataset. The yellow highlighted text emphasizes the difference in problem descriptions before and after introducing traps. Additionally, we annotate Conceptual Problems to test whether models possess trap-related knowledge. We hope that if a model can accurately answer both the Original Problems and the Conceptual Problems, it will also be able to accurately answer the Trap Problems. Appendix section 3.1 provides definitions of the trap types, and Table 11 offers explanations for these 5 example traps. We have included GPT-4-0125-preview's responses to selected problem from the table in Appendix Tables 12-15.}
\label{tab:overview}
\end{table}

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
We use accuracy as the evaluation metric for the problem. To measure compositional generalization, we calculate the ratio between the accuracy on trap questions and the accuracy on original questions. A model demonstrating good compositional generalization should exhibit similar performance before and after the introduction of trap questions, rather than showing degradation.

For Original Problems, following prior work (Yu et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2024; Xi et al., 2024; He et al., 2024), we calculate accuracy by determining whether the model's final answer matches the standard answer. For Trap Problems and Conceptual Problems, we additionally check the intermediate steps of the model's response to determine whether it correctly identified the trap. We employ GPT-4 as the judge for the checks. In experiments where GPT-4 might exhibit bias, we supplement our evaluation with results using Claude-3.5-Sonnet as an additional judge. We provide the prompts used for the evaluation in Table 6 in the Appendix.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{The Compositionality of LLMs}
We evaluate the compositionality of LLMs on the MATHTRAP dataset, with results shown in Table 2. Proprietary LLMs achieve over $70\%$ accuracy on these Conceptual Problems, with OpenAI o1 even reaching $96.2\%$. This indicates that LLMs possess the knowledge required to identify most traps. However, when comparing LLM performance on original versus trap problems, we observe a significant decline. Most proprietary LLMs achieve less than half their original accuracy on trap problems. This indicates that even advanced, well-aligned LLMs struggle to apply trap-related knowledge flexibly to novel reasoning paths. Notably, o1-preview(Web) achieved a ratio of 77.4, significantly higher than GPT-4's 51.2. This suggests that o1's test-time scaling, akin to human 'slow thinking', effectively improves LLM compositionality. However, it still falls short of the human ratio of 85.9. For detailed information on the human evaluation, please refer to Section 4.2.

Open-source models' ratios below 20 indicate that focusing solely on GSM8K and MATH accuracy doesn't truly enhance LLM reasoning abilities. Nevertheless, extensive pre-training (LLemma-MetaMath-7b vs. MetaMath-7b) and larger model scales (from 7b to 70b) still yield better compositional generalization effects (ratio increasing from $5.84\%$ to $19\%$).

\subsection{The Compositionality of Human}
As a control experiment, we evaluate human performance on the MATHTRAP dataset. Specifically, we recruit 43 undergraduate students majoring in science and engineering from top universities to participate in the experiment. Each student is randomly assigned two problems: one original problem and one trap problem. During the answering process, participants are not aware that the assigned problems might contain traps. To prevent participants from discovering the traps by comparing the two problems, the original problem and the trap problem assigned to each participant are completely different. The results are shown in Table 3. Humans achieve an accuracy of $83.8\%$ on the trap problems. In terms of the ratio of accuracy on trap problems to original problems, humans attained an accuracy ratio of $83.8 / 97.6 = 85.9\%$ far surpassing all existing LLMs. This indicates that humans demonstrate strong compositional reasoning ability on the MATHTRAP dataset. For cases where participants fail to correctly identify the traps, we further inform them that the problems might contain traps and ask them to answer again. After receiving this hint, the human accuracy rate increases from $83.8\%$ to $95.1\%$, almost identical to their performance on the original problems.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Mitigating LLMs' Failure on MathTrap}
The results in Table 2 show that LLMs have acquired the relevant knowledge needed to solve trap problems, but are unable to spontaneously apply this knowledge to reasoning on trap problems.

Therefore, we attempt to mitigate this issue through external interventions, with the specific results presented in Table 4 and 5. The GPT series models constitute a significant subset of proprietary models in Table 4. To mitigate potential bias in evaluating these models using GPT-4, we supplement our assessment with results using Claude-3.5-Sonnet as a judge.

Natural language prompt: Adding the prompt "Note that this problem may be unsolvable or has no solution" before the problem statement. Refer to Table 8 for the full prompt. Our results show that natural language prompts can guide LLMs to notice the contradictions or traps in the problem descriptions without affecting the accuracy on "Original Problems", especially for those well-aligned closed-source LLMs.

Few-shot demonstration: In the 1-shot setting, a randomly sampled trap problem and its reasoning process are inserted into the context (refer to Table 9 for the full prompt); in the 5-shot setting, 2 original problems and 3 trap problems with their reasoning processes are inserted (refer to Table 10). The results show that compared to natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations are more effective in handling trap problems. Additionally, in the 5-shot setting with a mix of original problems, the accuracy on original problems is also improved.

Fine-tuning: We use the MATHTRAP public subset containing 1,000 problem triplets for fine-tuning. Given that GPT-4 was employed for data augmentation, we included additional evaluation results using Claude-3.5-Sonnet in Table 5 to avoid potential assessment bias from using GPT-4 as both an augmenter and judge. The experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning can significantly improve model performance on trap problems without prompt, but it may also reduce the accuracy of solving original problems.

\section{Conclusions}
This paper investigates the compositional generalization of LLMs in mathematical reasoning. By introducing traps into the problem descriptions, we construct novel "Trap Problems" that cannot be solved by merely following trained reasoning paths for LLMs. Experiments on MATHTRAP demonstrate that LLMs fail to spontaneously combine their learned knowledge to reason about trap problems. Although this limitation can be mitigated through external interventions, there remains a significant gap compared to the compositional generalization capabilities of humans.

\section{Limitations}
The construction of trap problems places high demands on the annotators' abilities, resulting in high annotation costs. Therefore, how to automatically generate high-quality trap problems through automated methods is worthy of further investigation.

\subsection{Investigation on the Limitations of Transformer Capabilities}
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in various tasks requiring complex reasoning (OpenAI, 2023), such as coding (Guo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024) and solving mathematical problems (Luo et al., 2023; Toshniwal et al., 2024). Some researchers even view these exciting advancements as sparks of artificial general intelligence (Bubeck et al., 2023). In stark contrast, these models have shown unexpected failures in simple and intuitive tasks (Bian et al., 2024; Koralus and Wang-Mašćanica, 2023). For example, the state-of-the-art GPT-4 only achieve $59\%$ accuracy on three-digit multiplication problems (Dziri et al., 2023).

What is the reason behind this stark discrepancy? Recent studies have examined LLMs' ability to composite knowledge from training scenarios to solve more complex problems. Tests covered tasks such as boolean variable assignment (Anil et al., 2022), semantic parsing (Hosseini et al., 2022), deductive reasoning (Sanyal et al., 2022), and arithmetic reasoning (Kazemi et al., 2023). A common trend shows that as problem complexity increases, LLMs' accuracy drops significantly. Our MATHTRAP is based on math word problems, currently the most widely studied task for evaluating LLM reasoning. Unlike previous work that assessed models' compositional generalization by increasing problem complexity, we simply introduced straightforward logical traps into original problems without significantly increasing their complexity.

Researchers have also investigated whether LLMs' impressive reasoning abilities stem from learning general knowledge or merely reciting examples from their vast training corpora. Studies (Wu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023) on LLMs' performance in factual versus counterfactual scenarios revealed significant performance drops in counterfactual cases, suggesting LLMs often recite answers from common cases in their training data. Recent research (Dziri et al., 2023) modeled reasoning tasks as computational graphs, experimentally demonstrating that LLMs reason through sub [ILLEGIBLE] [MISSING]

\subsection{Math Word Problem Benchmark}
Mathematical word problems have long been considered an effective proxy for evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), garnering widespread attention from the academic community. Numerous benchmark datasets of math word problems have been proposed. ASDiv (Miao et al., 2020) is a dataset covering most knowledge types encountered in elementary school, with each problem annotated with its corresponding knowledge component and grade level. SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) comprises 1,000 challenging elementary math word problems carefully designed and curated to assess a system's complex reasoning and multi-step arithmetic capabilities. Cobbe et al. (2021) introduced GSM8K, a high-quality and diverse evaluation benchmark containing 8.5k math word problems. Hendrycks et al. (2021) presented MATH, a dataset of 12,500 challenging competition math problems. Recently, researchers have also constructed unanswerable math word problems to evaluate hallucinations in LLMs' mathematical reasoning process. However, evaluating LLMs' compositional abilities has been limited to symbolic reasoning tasks (Lake and Baroni, 2023; Dziri et al., 2023). Tang et al. (2024) found that semantics play a crucial role in the reasoning process, motivating our MATHTRAP dataset to evaluate LLMs' compositional skills on semantically rich math word problems.

\section{Annotation Process and Standards of MATHTRAP Dataset}
In this section, we provide a detailed explanation covering three aspects: the annotators' background, annotation criteria, and the annotation process.

\subsection{Qualified annotators}
Our annotation team consists of five students with STEM backgrounds from top universities, with an average math score of 145 out of 150 in their college entrance exams. They possess the necessary math knowledge and passed our qualification test, ensuring their ability to understand and complete our tasks with high quality.

\subsection{Clear and Specific Annotation Criteria}
Adherence to trap problem definition: We provided clear definitions and examples for five types of traps (as shown in 3.1). Annotators were required to fully understand these definitions and verify that their trap problems align with the corresponding trap definitions.

Unambiguity: We require annotators to mutually verify the semantic clarity of trap problems, ensuring the modified questions are unambiguous.

Difficulty: We set a standard that the trap problems should cause GPT-3.5 to give incorrect responses in at least 1 out of 5 runs, preventing overly simple trap problems.

Diversity: We dynamically monitored the distribution of knowledge points during the annotation process and provided feedback to annotators to adjust their selection of topics.

\subsection{Standardized Annotation Process}
Problem assignment and distribution: Problems from each knowledge point in the original datasets were equally distributed among five annotators. This approach was adopted to prevent potential bias that might arise if any single annotator were to focus on only a subset of knowledge points.

Quality control during annotation: We required strict adherence to annotation standards and recording of the verification process. A supervisor regularly checked the output for compliance with our standards and provided feedback.

Post-annotation quality assessment: All annotators cross-verified trap problems created by others, filtering out those that didn't meet the annotation standards.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Compared Method}
We evaluate mainstream proprietary and open-source LLMs with strong mathematical capabilities. Proprietary models include Claude3-Opus, Gemini-pro, OpenAI o1, GPT-4-0125-preview, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, and Kimi. The open-source models include the 7B, 13B, and 70B versions of Meta-Math (Yu et al., 2023), which are all based on the Llama-2 model. Additionally, we provide Llemma-MetaMath-7B, which is based on Llemma (Azerbayev et al., 2024), a foundation model pre-trained specifically for mathematics.

If \(r\) is a negative integer, and the maximum value of the expression \(5r^2 +br - 12\) is 36, what's the value of b? \\
\#\# Response: Let's think step by step. \\
Regardless of whether \(r\) is positive or negative, a parabola that opens upwards does not have a maximum value. \\
Therefore, it is impossible to equate the maximum value of the expression to 36 as the problem initially asks, and we cannot solve for \(b\) under these conditions. The question has posed an unsolvable scenario. \\

Therefore, under the given conditions, there is no solution to this problem. The constraints on \(x\) and \(y\) being odd integers and the equation \(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{x}{y}\) cannot hold true simultaneously. \\

\#\# Response: Let's think step by step. Let the two given sides be \(a\) and \(b\) . \\
... \\
In this case, \(a = 5\) and \(b = 7\) , so the inequalities become \(|5 - 7| < c < 5 + 7\) , which simplify to \(2 < c < 12\) . \\
Since \(c\) must be an integer, the possible integer lengths for the third side are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. \\
Therefore, there are 9 different integer lengths the third side can be. \\

Therefore, we can't express the equation in the standard form of a parabola, which indicates that the equation does not represent a parabola. Consequently, we cannot find a focus for a parabola because the given equation does not describe a parabola. The initial assumption that we are dealing with a parabola is incorrect. \\

In right triangle XYZ with $\angle YXZ = 90^\circ$, we have XY = 24 and YZ = 25. Find tan X. & Alright, in our right triangle XYZ where $\angle YXZ = 90^\circ$, we're given the lengths XY = 24 and YZ = 25. To find tan X, we're essentially looking for the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side of angle X. Let's break it down: Let's go through the calculation:- First, solve for XZ: $25^2 = 24^2 + XZ^2$ leads to $625 = 576 + XZ^2$, which simplifies to $XZ^2 = 625 - 576 = 49$.- Taking the square root of both sides gives XZ = 7.Finally, to find tan X, we use the lengths XY (opposite side to X) and XZ (adjacent side to X): tan X = $24 / 7$. This gives us a detailed step-by-step approach to finding tan X in the triangle XYZ where $\angle YXZ = 90^\circ$, with XY = 24 and YZ = 25. \\

We have the lengths of two sides: XY = 24 and YZ = 25. The side XY can be considered as the side opposite to $\angle YXZ$, and YZ can be thought of as the hypotenuse of the triangle.However, to find tan X, we actually need to know the relationship between the side adjacent to $\angle X$ (which would be XZ in this case) and the side opposite to $\angle X$ (which is XY). Let's apply this theorem to find XZ: $XY^2 + XZ^2 = YZ^2$ Plugging in the values we know, we get: $24^2 + XZ^2 = 25^2$ Solving for $XZ^2$, we get: $XZ^2 = 25^2 - 24^2 = 625 - 576 = 49$ Taking the square root of both sides gives us XZ = 7.Now that we have the length of the side adjacent to $\angle X$, we can find tan X: $tan X = XY / XZ = 24 / 7$ Therefore, [ILLEGIBLE] \\

The mention of May's sales seems to be there to potentially confuse or add extra information that doesn't directly pertain to the question as asked.Given that we only have data for April and May, and the question asks for the total for April and June without providing information on June's sales, we can't accurately determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in both [MISSING] and June.

An equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 30 centimeters and a height of 10 centimeters. Calculate the area of the triangle. & Given that the equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 30 centimeters, we can first find the length of one side. Since an equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length, we can divide the perimeter by 3: Side length = $30 / 3 = 10$ cm Now, to find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $1/2 \times$ base $\times$ height. However, for an equilateral triangle, we can also use the formula involving its side length and height. Since we know both the side length and the height, we can use the following formula where h is the height: Area = $1/2 \times$ Side length $\times$ h $= 1/2 \times 10 \times 10 = 50$ cm² Therefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 50 cm².However, there's a catch. The height given doesn't align with the properties of an equilateral triangle where each side is 10 cm. In an equilateral triangle, the height (h) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem for a 30-60-90 triangle, which is derived from dividing the equilateral triangle into two right triangles. The formula for the height in terms of the side length (a) is: $h = \sqrt{3}/2 a$ For a side length of 10 cm, the correct height would be: $h = \sqrt{3}/2 \times 10 \approx 8.66$ cm So, if we were to use the correct height in calculating the area, it would actually be: $A = 1/2 \times 10 \times 8.66 \approx 43.3$ cm² Therefore, with the height given as 10 cm, the problem doesn't align with the properties of an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 cm each. This discrepancy suggests a misunderstanding in the problem statement as the height and the properties of the equilateral triangle given do not match. & [MISSING] \\

Max picks five different cards without replacement from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the cards are of different suits? & To calculate the probability that Max picks five different cards of different suits from a standard 52-card deck without replacement, we need to consider the composition of the deck and the sequence of his picks. 1. **First Card:** ... 5. **Fifth Card:** The fifth card can be of any suit since we're only looking for different suits in the first four cards. Overall Probability = ... $\approx 0.1055$ So, the probability that Max picks five different cards of different suits from a standard 52-card deck without replacement is approximately 0.1055, or 0.1055.4. **Fourth Card:** For the fourth card, it must be one of the 13 cards left that belong to the suit not yet chosen, out of the 49 cards remaining, giving a probability of 13/49. The overall probability is then calculated by multiplying these probabilities together, reflecting the sequence of choices Max makes under the condition that each card comes from a different suit: Probability = $52/52 \times 39/51 \times 26/50 \times 13/49$ However, since the original question asks about five cards from different suits in a 52-card deck, which only contains four suits, the scenario is not achievable. & [MISSING] \\

Conceptual Problem: Does tan 90° exist? & [MISSING] & True. To understand why, let's break it down. The tangent function, represented as tan($\theta$), is defined as the ratio of the sine of angle $\theta$ to the cosine of angle $\theta$. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as: $tan(\theta) = sin(\theta)/cos(\theta)$ When we apply this definition to tan(90), we encounter an issue. The sine of 90 degrees is 1, but the cosine of 90 degrees is 0. Plugging these values into our formula gives us: $tan(90) = sin(90)/cos(90) = 1 / 0$ Division by zero is undefined in mathematics. Because the cosine of 90 degrees is 0, attempting to calculate tan(90) results in an undefined operation. Therefore, it is true to say that tan(90) does not exist due to this division by zero. \\

An equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 30 centimeters. Calculate the area of the triangle. & $25\sqrt{3}$ cm² & To calculate the area of an equilateral triangle, you first need to know the length of one side. Since the perimeter of the triangle is given as 30 centimeters, and an equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length, each side of the triangle is: Side length = Perimeter/3 = $30$ cm/3 = $10$ cm The formula to calculate the area A of an equilateral triangle with side length s is: $A = \sqrt{3}/4 s^2$ Plugging in the side length: $A = \sqrt{3}/4 \times (10$ cm$)^2$ $A = \sqrt{3}/4 \times 100$ cm² $A = 25\sqrt{3}$ cm² Let's calculate the exact numeric value of the area. The area of the equilateral triangle is approximately 43.30 square centimeters. \\
\hline
Conceptual Problem: Can the height of an equilateral triangle be equal to its side length? & [MISSING] & To figure out if the height of an equilateral triangle can be equal to its side length, let's analyze the properties of an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle has all three sides of the same length. If we draw a height from one vertex to the opposite side, it not only acts as a height but also bisects the base into two equal parts, creating two 30-60-90 right triangles. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of $1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$. Here, the smallest side (opposite the 30° angle) would be half the length of the hypotenuse (the original side of the equilateral triangle), and the height (opposite the 60° angle) would be $\sqrt{3}/2$ times the length of the hypotenuse. So, if the side length of the equilateral triangle is s, the height h would be $s \times \sqrt{3}/2$. For the height to be equal to the side length, $s = s \times \sqrt{3}/2$, which is not true unless s = 0 (which is not a valid length for a side of a triangle). **Conclusion:** False, the height of an equilateral triangle cannot be equal to its side length. \\

Natalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many clips in May.

So, if she sold 48 clips in April, then in May she sold $1/2 \times 48 = 24$ clips. To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we simply add the two amounts together: $48 + 24 = 72$ So, **Natalia sold a total of 72 clips** to her friends over the two months. \\

Knowing the sales for May gives you insight into the performance of that specific month but does not contribute any direct information about July's sales. Without the sales data for July, you cannot accurately determine the sum of June and July's sales. Therefore, it's not possible to calculate this sum with the information provided. \\

Max picks 2 different cards without replacement from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the cards are of different suits? & 13 & To find the probability that Max picks two cards of different suits from a standard 52-card deck, we first need to understand the deck's composition and the process of drawing cards without replacement. 1. **Deck Composition**: A standard deck of 52 cards consists of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. 2. **First Card Draw**: When Max draws the first card, it can be of any suit. This event is certain, so the probability is 1. 3. **Second Card Draw**: After the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck. Since we want the second card to be of a different suit, we need to exclude the remaining 12 cards of the same suit as the first card. This leaves us with 39 cards (51 total minus 12 of the same suit) that are of a different suit. 4. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability that the second card is of a different suit is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability is 39/51. 5. **Final Probability**: Since the first card can be of any suit and does not affect the probability, the final probability that the two cards drawn are of different suits is $1 \times 39/51$, which simplifies to 39/51. Therefore, the probability that Max picks two cards of different suits without replacement from a standard 52-card deck is 39/51, which can be simplified further if needed. \\

Conceptual Problem: Is it possible to pick five different suits of cards from a standard deck of playing cards? & [MISSING] & Yes, it's possible to select five different suits of cards from a standard deck of playing cards, but there's a small catch. A standard deck of playing cards typically contains four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. So, if you're selecting five suits, you'd have to include all four of these plus one more. However, since there are only four suits in a standard deck, you can't pick five different ones. You could say you're selecting all the suits in the deck, but not five different ones. \\
