\begin{abstract}
Human cognition exhibits systematic compositionality, the algebraic ability to generate infinite novel combinations from finite learned components, which is the key to understanding and reasoning about complex logic. In this work, we investigate the compositionality of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we construct a new dataset \textsc{MathTrap} by introducing carefully designed logical traps into the problem descriptions of MATH and GSM8K. Since problems with logical flaws are quite rare in the real world, these represent ``unseen'' cases to LLMs. Solving these requires the models to systematically compose (1) the mathematical knowledge involved in the original problems with (2) knowledge related to the introduced traps. Our experiments show that while LLMs possess both components of requisite knowledge, they do not spontaneously combine them to handle these novel cases. We explore several methods to mitigate this deficiency, such as natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and fine-tuning. Additionally, we test the recently released OpenAI o1 model and find that human-like ``slow thinking'' helps improve the compositionality of LLMs. Overall, systematic compositionality remains an open challenge for large language models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Humans excel at learning fundamental concepts and skills, systematically combining them to solve new problems. For instance, when a person possesses (a) the knowledge of how to solve quadratic equations with one variable, and (b) the understanding of what integers are, they can combine these two domains of knowledge to tackle the problem ``Find the integer solutions of $x^2 + x = 3$.'' They would first solve the equation, and then determine whether the obtained solutions are integers or not. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) had a famous viewpoint that artificial neural networks lack this compositionality, and thus cannot serve as reliable cognitive models. Current LLMs have achieved unprecedented success on tasks requiring complex reasoning \cite{guo2024deepseek, toshniwal2024openmathinstruct}. We wonder whether compositionality still poses a significant challenge for LLMs?

Toward this goal, we construct a new \textsc{MathTrap} dataset by introducing carefully designed logical traps into the original problems of the MATH \cite{hendrycks2021measuring} and GSM8K \cite{cobbe2021training} datasets. For example, by modifying the original problem ``Find the solution of the equation $x^2 + x = 3$'' to ``Find the integer solution of the equation $x^2 + x = 3$,'' the model needs to combine (a) the knowledge involved in the original problem (how to solve quadratic equations with one variable) and (b) the knowledge about the trap (the definition of integers) to handle these trap problems (in fact, the original equation has no integer solutions). Another reason for evaluating compositionality through trap problems is that these problems rarely appear in the real world, so it is unlikely that LLMs provide the correct answers solely by following the trained reasoning paths.

We conduct comprehensive tests on leading LLMs and recruit 43 undergraduate students from top universities as human controls. We find that LLMs and humans exhibit strikingly different behavioral patterns when dealing with trap problems. Despite possessing both (a) and (b) knowledge components, LLMs fail to spontaneously compose them to handle trap problems, while humans can. This suggests that tasks requiring compositional generalization remain challenging for current LLMs. Furthermore, the ability of well-aligned LLMs to handle trap problems can be elicited through external interventions, such as natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and supervised fine-tuning. Furthermore, we find that the human-like ``slow thinking'' demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 \cite{openai2024o1} also helps improve the compositionality of LLMs. Nevertheless, systematic compositionality remains an open challenge for current LLMs.

The contributions of this work are threefold: (1) We investigate the compositional generalization of LLMs on mathematical reasoning, and demonstrate their stark underperformance compared to humans. (2) An effective method to construct ``unseen problems'' by introducing traps into original problems, and a dataset called \textsc{MathTrap} that cannot be solved by simply following the reasoning paths seen during training. (3) Comprehensive experiments exploring the impact of model size, the degree of alignment, and external interventions on performance on the \textsc{MathTrap}.

\section{Background and Definition}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, we provide the definition of compositionality discussed in this paper, based on Hilbert's formal deductive systems \cite{hilbert1922grundlagen}:

\begin{definition}[Hilbert's Formal Deductive System]
This system consists of (1) a syntax $\mathcal{P}$, specifying which derivation statements are legal, (2) a set of inference rules $\mathcal{R}$, clearly stating how new facts (or theorems) can be derived from existing facts (axioms or already proved theorems), and (3) axioms: a predetermined set $\mathcal{A}$ of established facts.
\end{definition}

Under this deductive system, reasoning is defined as the process of deriving new facts from existing facts and rules.

\begin{definition}[Compositionality in Mathematical Reasoning]
Suppose problem sets $\mathcal{Q}_1$, $\mathcal{Q}_2$, $\mathcal{Q}_3$ are described using the same syntax $\mathcal{P}$, and $\mathcal{Q}_1$ and $\mathcal{Q}_2$ can derive final answers through tuple $(\mathcal{R}_1, \mathcal{A}_1)$, $(\mathcal{R}_2, \mathcal{A}_2)$ respectively, while $\mathcal{Q}_3$ requires reasoning using $\mathcal{R}_1 \cup \mathcal{R}_2$ based on $\mathcal{A}_1 \cup \mathcal{A}_2$ (or a subset) to derive the final answer. If a reasoning engine can solve $\mathcal{Q}_1$ and $\mathcal{Q}_2$, we say it possesses compositionality if it can solve $\mathcal{Q}_3$.
\end{definition}

\section{The \textsc{MathTrap} Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

Existing datasets for evaluating compositionality are limited to symbolic reasoning with semantic decoupling \cite{lake2023human, dziri2023faith}. However, the semantics of language play a crucial role in the reasoning process of LLMs \cite{tang2024paradox}. Our \textsc{MathTrap} dataset aims to evaluate the compositionality of LLMs on semantically rich math word problems. More importantly, the ``unseen'' feature of our dataset prevents models from simply following the trained reasoning paths to arrive at solutions.

\subsection{Dataset Composition}
\label{ssec:composition}

Sample Composition: As illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:trap_types}, each sample in \textsc{MathTrap} can be viewed as a problem triplet:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Original problem}: Sampled from the MATH and GSM8K datasets. These problems are used to evaluate the model's grasp of math knowledge from these datasets.
    \item \textbf{Conceptual Problem}: Manually crafted to assess the model's understanding of the trap concepts to be introduced. These problems are intentionally simple, requiring only knowledge of the trap concept to solve.
    \item \textbf{Trap Problem}: Created by manually introducing logical traps into the original problems. These are designed to evaluate the model's compositional generalization ability. Solving these problems requires the model to systematically combine knowledge from the original math problem with the introduced trap concept.
\end{enumerate}

The \textsc{MathTrap} dataset consists of two subsets: Public and Private. The Public subset contains 105 problem triplets. Using GPT-4, we paraphrase these samples to expand the dataset to 1,000 problem triplets, which are used in all fine-tuning experiments discussed in this paper. We manually verify the quality of the subset. Please refer to Table~\ref{tab:paraphrase_templates} for the templates used in paraphrasing. We have made this subset publicly available to facilitate community evaluation of compositionality.

The Private subset comprises 155 problem triplets, and the evaluation results presented in this paper are based on this subset. This portion of the data will not be made public to mitigate the risk of data leakage.\footnote{Researchers and institutions interested in evaluating their models on the Private subset can contact us to arrange for testing.}

Problem Topic Composition: \textsc{MathTrap} comprises problems from two main sources: 15.5\% from the GSM8K dataset and 84.5\% from the MATH dataset. It covers a diverse range of mathematical topics, including algebra (23.2\%), counting and probability (22.6\%), geometry (16.7\%), prealgebra (12.3\%), number theory (22.7\%), and precalculus (2.6\%).

Trap Categories: We carefully designed five categories of traps for constructing the \textsc{MathTrap} dataset. These include: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Concept Undefined}: The reasoning process involves undefined mathematical concepts (such as $\tan 90^\circ$, 0 as a divisor, etc.).
    \item \textbf{Missing Condition}: Lacking the necessary conditions required to solve the problem.
    \item \textbf{Direct Contradiction}: Two conditions in the problem description directly contradict each other, which can be discovered without complex calculations.
    \item \textbf{Indirect Contradiction}: There are indirect contradictions in the problem description, which can only be discovered during the reasoning process.
    \item \textbf{Violating Common Sense}: The condition or final answer violates common sense.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
\label{ssec:evaluation}

We use accuracy as the evaluation metric for the problem. To measure compositional generalization, we calculate the ratio between the accuracy on trap questions and the accuracy on original questions. A model demonstrating good compositional generalization should exhibit similar performance before and after the introduction of trap questions, rather than showing degradation.

For Original Problems, following prior work \cite{yu2023metamath, gou2024tora, xi2024training, he2024self}, we calculate accuracy by determining whether the model's final answer matches the standard answer. For Trap Problems and Conceptual Problems, we additionally check the intermediate steps of the model's response to determine whether it correctly identified the trap. We employ GPT-4 as the judge for the checks. In experiments where GPT-4 might exhibit bias, we supplement our evaluation with results using Claude-3.5-Sonnet as an additional judge. We provide the prompts used for the evaluation in Table~\ref{tab:evaluation_prompt} in the Appendix.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{The Compositionality of LLMs}
\label{ssec:llm_compositionality}

We evaluate the compositionality of LLMs on the \textsc{MathTrap} dataset, with results shown in Table~\ref{tab:main_results}. Proprietary LLMs achieve over 70\% accuracy on these Conceptual Problems, with OpenAI o1 even reaching 96.2\%. This indicates that LLMs possess the knowledge required to identify most traps. However, when comparing LLM performance on original versus trap problems, we observe a significant decline. Most proprietary LLMs achieve less than half their original accuracy on trap problems. This indicates that even advanced, well-aligned LLMs struggle to apply trap-related knowledge flexibly to novel reasoning paths. Notably, o1-preview (Web) achieved a ratio of 77.4, significantly higher than GPT-4's 51.2. This suggests that o1's test-time scaling, akin to human ``slow thinking'', effectively improves LLM compositionality. However, it still falls short of the human ratio of 85.9. For detailed information on the human evaluation, please refer to Section~\ref{ssec:human_compositionality}.

Open-source models' ratios below 20 indicate that focusing solely on GSM8K and MATH accuracy doesn't truly enhance LLM reasoning abilities. Nevertheless, extensive pre-training (Llemma-MetaMath-7B vs. MetaMath-7B) and larger model scales (from 7B to 70B) still yield better compositional generalization effects (ratio increasing from 5.84\% to 19\%).

\end{table*}

\subsection{The Compositionality of Human}
\label{ssec:human_compositionality}

As a control experiment, we evaluate human performance on the \textsc{MathTrap} dataset. Specifically, we recruit 43 undergraduate students majoring in science and engineering from top universities to participate in the experiment. Each student is randomly assigned two problems: one original problem and one trap problem.\footnote{We only assign two problems because once participants discover that a problem contains a trap, they would consciously look for traps in subsequent problems, which would affect the accuracy of the results.} During the answering process, participants are not aware that the assigned problems might contain traps. To prevent participants from discovering the traps by comparing the two problems, the original problem and the trap problem assigned to each participant are completely different. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:human_results}. Humans achieve an accuracy of 83.8\% on the trap problems. In terms of the ratio of accuracy on trap problems to original problems, humans attained an accuracy ratio of $83.8/97.6 = 85.9\%$, far surpassing all existing LLMs. This indicates that humans demonstrate strong compositional reasoning ability on the \textsc{MathTrap} dataset. For cases where participants fail to correctly identify the traps, we further inform them that the problems might contain traps and ask them to answer again. After receiving this hint, the human accuracy rate increases from 83.8\% to 95.1\%, almost identical to their performance on the original problems.

\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Human Accuracy (\%)} \\

\label{tab:human_results}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mitigating LLMs' Failure on \textsc{MathTrap}}
\label{ssec:mitigation}

The results in Table~\ref{tab:main_results} show that LLMs have acquired the relevant knowledge needed to solve trap problems, but are unable to spontaneously apply this knowledge to reasoning on trap problems. Therefore, we attempt to mitigate this issue through external interventions, with the specific results presented in Tables~\ref{tab:intervention_results} and \ref{tab:finetuning_results}.

Natural language prompt: Adding the prompt ``Note that this problem may be unsolvable or has no solution'' before the problem statement. Refer to Table~\ref{tab:prompt_template} for the full prompt. Our results show that natural language prompts can guide LLMs to notice the contradictions or traps in the problem descriptions without affecting the accuracy on ``Original Problems'', especially for those well-aligned closed-source LLMs.

Few-shot demonstration: In the 1-shot setting, a randomly sampled trap problem and its reasoning process are inserted into the context (refer to Table~\ref{tab:oneshot_template} for the full prompt); in the 5-shot setting, 2 original problems and 3 trap problems with their reasoning processes are inserted (refer to Table~\ref{tab:fiveshot_template}). The results show that compared to natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations are more effective in handling trap problems. Additionally, in the 5-shot setting with a mix of original problems, the accuracy on original problems is also improved.

Fine-tuning: We use the \textsc{MathTrap} public subset containing 1,000 problem triplets for fine-tuning. Given that GPT-4 was employed for data augmentation, we included additional evaluation results using Claude-3.5-Sonnet in Table~\ref{tab:finetuning_results} to avoid potential assessment bias from using GPT-4 as both an augmenter and judge. The experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning can significantly improve model performance on trap problems without prompt, but it may also reduce the accuracy of solving original problems.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper investigates the compositional generalization of LLMs in mathematical reasoning. By introducing traps into the problem descriptions, we construct novel ``Trap Problems'' that cannot be solved by merely following trained reasoning paths for LLMs. Experiments on \textsc{MathTrap} demonstrate that LLMs fail to spontaneously combine their learned knowledge to reason about trap problems. Although this limitation can be mitigated through external interventions, there remains a significant gap compared to the compositional generalization capabilities of humans.

\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

The construction of trap problems places high demands on the annotators' abilities, resulting in high annotation costs. Therefore, how to automatically generate high-quality trap problems through automated methods is worthy of further investigation.

\subsection{Related Works}
\label{ssec:related_works}

\subsubsection{Investigation on the Limitations of Transformer Capabilities}
\label{sssec:transformer_limitations}

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in various tasks requiring complex reasoning \cite{openai2023gpt4}, such as coding \cite{guo2024deepseek,zheng2024opencodeinterpreter} and solving mathematical problems \cite{luo2023wizardmath,toshniwal2024openmathinstruct}. Some researchers even view these exciting advancements as sparks of artificial general intelligence \cite{bubeck2023sparks}. In stark contrast, these models have shown unexpected failures in simple and intuitive tasks \cite{bian2024chatgpt,koralus2023humans}. For example, the state-of-the-art GPT-4 only achieves 59\% accuracy on three-digit multiplication problems \cite{dziri2023faith}.

What is the reason behind this stark discrepancy? Recent studies have examined LLMs' ability to composite knowledge from training scenarios to solve more complex problems. Tests covered tasks such as boolean variable assignment \cite{anil2022exploring}, semantic parsing \cite{hosseini2022compositional}, deductive reasoning \cite{sanyal2022robustlr}, and arithmetic reasoning \cite{kazemi2023lambada}. A common trend shows that as problem complexity increases, LLMs' accuracy drops significantly. Our \textsc{MathTrap} is based on math word problems, currently the most widely studied task for evaluating LLM reasoning. Unlike previous work that assessed models' compositional generalization by increasing problem complexity, we simply introduced straightforward logical traps into original problems without significantly increasing their complexity.

Researchers have also investigated whether LLMs' impressive reasoning abilities stem from learning general knowledge or merely reciting examples from their vast training corpora. Studies \cite{wu2024reasoning,zhang2023counterfactual} on LLMs' performance in factual versus counterfactual scenarios revealed significant performance drops in counterfactual cases, suggesting LLMs often recite answers from common cases in their training data. Recent research \cite{dziri2023faith} modeled reasoning tasks as computational graphs, experimentally demonstrating that LLMs reason through subgraph matching rather than developing systematic problem-solving skills. Another study \cite{hu2024case} removed certain samples from the training set and found that LLMs rely on surrounding cases in the training set for mathematical reasoning rather than learning generalizable rules. These findings indicate that LLMs still face challenges in learning knowledge and combining them to solve out-of-distribution problems.

\subsubsection{Math Word Problem Benchmark}
\label{sssec:math_benchmarks}

Mathematical word problems have long been considered an effective proxy for evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), garnering widespread attention from the academic community. Numerous benchmark datasets of math word problems have been proposed. ASDiv \cite{miao2020diverse} is a dataset covering most knowledge types encountered in elementary school, with each problem annotated with its corresponding knowledge component and grade level. SVAMP \cite{patel2021nlp} comprises 1,000 challenging elementary math word problems carefully designed and curated to assess a system's complex reasoning and multi-step arithmetic capabilities. \citet{cobbe2021training} introduced GSM8K, a high-quality and diverse evaluation benchmark containing 8.5k math word problems. \citet{hendrycks2021measuring} presented MATH, a dataset of 12,500 challenging competition math problems. Recently, researchers have also constructed unanswerable math word problems to evaluate hallucinations in LLMs' mathematical reasoning process. However, evaluating LLMs' compositional abilities has been limited to symbolic reasoning tasks \cite{lake2023human,dziri2023faith}. \citet{tang2024paradox} found that semantics play a crucial role in the reasoning process, motivating our \textsc{MathTrap} dataset to evaluate LLMs' compositional skills on semantically rich math word problems.

\subsection{Annotation Process and Standards of \textsc{MathTrap} Dataset}
\label{ssec:annotation}

In this section, we provide a detailed explanation covering three aspects: the annotators' background, annotation criteria, and the annotation process.

\subsubsection{Qualified Annotators}
\label{sssec:annotators}

Our annotation team consists of five students with STEM backgrounds from top universities, with an average math score of 145 out of 150 in their college entrance exams. They possess the necessary math knowledge and passed our qualification test, ensuring their ability to understand and complete our tasks with high quality.

\subsubsection{Clear and Specific Annotation Criteria}
\label{sssec:criteria}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adherence to trap problem definition}: We provided clear definitions and examples for five types of traps (as shown in Section~\ref{ssec:composition}). Annotators were required to fully understand these definitions and verify that their trap problems align with the corresponding trap definitions.
    \item \textbf{Unambiguity}: We require annotators to mutually verify the semantic clarity of trap problems, ensuring the modified questions are unambiguous.
    \item \textbf{Difficulty}: We set a standard that the trap problems should cause GPT-3.5 to give incorrect responses in at least 1 out of 5 runs, preventing overly simple trap problems.
    \item \textbf{Diversity}: We dynamically monitored the distribution of knowledge points during the annotation process and provided feedback to annotators to adjust their selection of topics.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Standardized Annotation Process}
\label{sssec:process}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem assignment and distribution}: Problems from each knowledge point in the original datasets were equally distributed among five annotators. This approach was adopted to prevent potential bias that might arise if any single annotator were to focus on only a subset of knowledge points.
    \item \textbf{Quality control during annotation}: We required strict adherence to annotation standards and recording of the verification process. A supervisor regularly checked the output for compliance with our standards and provided feedback.
    \item \textbf{Post-annotation quality assessment}: All annotators cross-verified trap problems created by others, filtering out those that didn't meet the annotation standards.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Details}
\label{ssec:evaluation_details}

\subsubsection{Compared Methods}
\label{sssec:methods}

We evaluate mainstream proprietary and open-source LLMs with strong mathematical capabilities. Proprietary models include Claude3-Opus, Gemini-pro, OpenAI o1, GPT-4-0125-preview, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, and Kimi. The open-source models include the 7B, 13B, and 70B versions of MetaMath \cite{yu2023metamath}, which are all based on the Llama-2 model. Additionally, we provide Llemma-MetaMath-7B, which is based on Llemma \cite{azerbayev2024llemma}, a foundation model pretrained specifically for mathematics.

\subsubsection{Prompt Templates}

Table~\ref{tab:paraphrase_templates} displays the prompt templates for enhancing the training set answers with GPT-4. Table~\ref{tab:prompt_template} shows the prompt templates used to indicate that a model's question might be unsolvable. Table~\ref{tab:oneshot_template} presents the prompt templates for in-context learning in a 1-shot setting. Table~\ref{tab:fiveshot_template} presents the prompt templates for in-context learning in a 5-shot setting.
